2,"Data for the Northwest Territories are reported with Manitoba and are not available separately."
3,"Effective March 22, 2018, separate numbers for Nunavut and Yukon are now presented for data back to January 2000."
4,"Seasonally adjusted data have been produced using X12 ARIMA seasonal adjustment program."
5,"Travel data for NEXUS Highway, which is a program designed to expedite the border clearance process for low-risk, pre-approved travellers into Canada and the United States, are now included. Monthly data has been revised back to January 2010 to reflect this change."
6,"In 2013, Statistics Canada updated the method used to estimate the number of same-day and overnight commercial plane trips made by United States residents entering Canada via one of the following three airports: Pearson (Toronto), Trudeau (Montréal) and Vancouver. This change created a break in the time series on the number of same-day and overnight commercial air trips made by American residents entering Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia. Please note that the methodological update does not affect the total number of United States residents travelling to Canada by commercial air. The 2013 and 2014 data on the number of same-day and overnight commercial air trips made by United States residents, however, have been revised."
7,"Effective March 22, 2018, this table now includes separate numbers for travellers entering by plane that are presented for data back to January 2000. "
8,"Effective March 22, 2018, the series containing other modes of transport include; pedestrian, bus, train, boat, (commercial and private) and other vehicles, and are presented for data back to January 2000. Data for the series prior to January 2000 include air travel."
9,"Effective March 22, 2018, this table now includes data for Prince Edward Island that are presented for data back to January 2000."
10,"Figures may not add up to totals due to rounding."
11,"Starting with January 2019 data, Statistics Canada updated the method of determining trip durations for US residents travelling to Canada and Canadian residents returning from the United States by all modes of transportation except by automobile and by bus. This change affects the relative proportions of same-day/overnight travellers. Caution is therefore advised when comparing 2019 data with earlier time periods for these modes of transportation."
